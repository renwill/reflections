What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

"git init" gives the message initialized empty Git repository in the working directory and creates  a .git folder to store all the files' history information


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
Staging area is a place where a logical set of files will get committed together.

What value do you think it offers?
It allows a set of related changes to be grouped together to reflect a logical change and commit in the repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use "git add" to add all the files of the logical changes to the staging area and use  "git reset HEAD" to remove any accidental addition from the staging area before issuing the "git commit" command.
